“Sounds neat! How do I use it?” you might be saying.

Installing Vim is relatively simple, but it depends on your operating system. On MacOS, you need to have the XCode Developer Tools(Verify & Link) installed. For Linux, it will depend on your distro. For example, in Ubuntu, you will need to type `sudo apt-get install vim`.
